# JavaScript target for ANTLR 4

Fork of the JavaScript runtime libraries for ANTLR 4.

This is a fork of the original [ANTLR 4 JavaScript runtime](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/javascript-target.md) modified for use with the [VSDX Export for yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles/vsdx-export) from yWorks.

This runtime has been tested in Node.js, Safari, Firefox, Chrome and IE.

See www.antlr.org for more information on ANTLR

See https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/javascript-target.md for more information on using ANTLR in JavaScript
